# dummy-crypto-trading-bot

Project Overview:
This is an independent trading bot designed to assess cryptocurrency markets and execute trades automatically. It uses the CCXT library to fetch real-time data for analysing market trends.

Key Features-
Market Analysis: It uses algorithms to identify market trends based on market indicators.
Risk Management: It has to maintain a strict 1:2 risk-to-reward ratio on every single trade.
Paper Trading Mode: It runs in sandbox mode (simulation mode), hence testing the strategy without involving any real money.
Automatic Execution: It automatically submits orders and also manages them by adding stop losses and take profits.
